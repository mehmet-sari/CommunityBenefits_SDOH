### Calculation the Cost of Uncompensated Care in HCRIS

Thanks to the detail instruction of CMS, it is easy to figure out how uncompensated care is calculated in CMS. 
The regular calculation of uncompensated care in the literature is simply the sum of bad debt and charity care. The Cost report data provides Worksheet S-10 that includes data regarding uncompensated care. Here is the definition of uncompensated care stated in the instruction:

> Uncompensated care consists of charity care, non-Medicare bad debt, and non-reimbursable
Medicare bad debt. Uncompensated care does not include courtesy allowances, discounts given
to patients that do not meet the hospitalâ€™s charity care policy, or discounts given to uninsured
patients that do not meet the hospital's FAP, or bad debt reimbursed by Medicare.
