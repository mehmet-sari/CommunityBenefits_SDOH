# CommunityHealth Project
## Community Benefit Provision by Hospitals
This is the project that we examine how community benefits provisions by hospitals vary over hospital-insurer market share and market power. 
There are three projects under the main projects. 

1. First project studies how community benefits provision changes by hospital market share using the data from AHA and IRS 990 form.
2. Second project adds insurers market shares and examines whether they affect the ability of provision of hospitals. The new data is Interstudy data.
3. Third projects studies same question using MA all payer claims data.

For this project I use only pyhton for data collection, cleaning and organizing. For data analysis, I use Pandas, R and Stata.
